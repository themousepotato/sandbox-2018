This is a place to practice git. Your first exercise is to add your name to this list.
To complete this exercise you need to:

Your entry should maintain alphabetic order and it should be in the format:

- `your name [username](http://github.com/username)`. 

Some more guidelines:

* Your Pull Request must be rebased on the latest master.
* Your Pull Request must have only one commit (If there are multiple commits, you should squash them).
* This commit must have a message that resembles: `Add name to README (Name here)` (Use only first name in case the commit message goes over 50 characters).
* Name of the PR must be informative: `Add my name to the README (Name here)`.
* Only one line should be there in the diff of your Pull Request.

This file is written in the [Markdown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Lines starting with `*` are automatically rendered as bullet points and phrases containing `[name](URL)` are automatically hyperlinked.
